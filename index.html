              <h2>Understanding Stage I</h2>
            </div>
            <p className="lead">Stage I teaches children to notice and describe their first spontaneous response to a hidden target, before analytical thinking takes over. It's about learning to catch the signal before the mind starts making up stories.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="concept-section">
            <h3>What is This Teaching?</h3>
            <div className="concept-grid">
              <div className="concept-card">
                <h4>The Fast Mark</h4>
                <p>When we hear the target number, something happens in our awareness before we start thinking about it. A quick gesture, a movement impulse. Stage I teaches the child to let that impulse show up on paper without planning it.</p>
                <p className="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This unplanned mark often contains information about the target's physical character—its shape, orientation, or movement quality—that the conscious mind hasn't yet processed.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="concept-card">
                <h4>Simple Descriptors</h4>
                <p>After the mark appears, we describe it with the simplest possible words: how it moved (up, down, across, curved) and how it would feel physically (hard, soft, rough, smooth). Not what it might BE, just how it IS.</p>
                <p className="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> By keeping descriptions simple and physical, we avoid jumping to analytical guesses. "It went up and feels hard" is data. "It's a mountain" is a guess that can blind us to what's actually there.</p>
              </div>

              <div className="concept-card">
                <h4>The Helper Word</h4>
                <p>Sometimes a tiny category word pops up with the mark: land, water, building, air. We only take it if it arrives spontaneously, and we immediately write "none" if nothing comes.</p>
                <p className="why"><strong>Why it matters:</strong> This teaches the child to distinguish between something that "just appeared" versus something they're thinking about or trying to figure out. It's the beginning of recognizing signal versus noise.</p>
              </div>
            </div>
          </div>

          <div className="concept-section">
            <h3>Why This Structure?</h3>
            <div className="explanation-block">
              <p>The child's mind naturally wants to jump to conclusions: "It's a house! It's a car! It's a dragon!" This is normal and human. But those conclusions often miss accurate information that came in the first instant.</p>
              <p>Stage I creates a simple ritual that lets the child capture that first instant before analysis takes over:</p>
              <ol className="explanation-list">
                <li><strong>Number → Mark:</strong> Something spontaneous happens before thinking begins</li>
                <li><strong>Mark → Movement:</strong> Describe the physical action, not the meaning</li>
                <li><strong>Movement → Feeling:</strong> Notice the physical quality, not what it represents</li>
                <li><strong>Maybe a tiny word:</strong> If something popped up by itself, capture it. If not, that's fine.</li>
              </ol>
              <p>This structure becomes automatic with practice. Eventually, the child knows: "I make a mark, I say how it moved and felt, I check for a tiny word, then I'm done." That automaticity is what allows genuine signal to come through.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

                  <h4>Trust the First Response</h4>
                  <p>The first mark, the first word that comes—those often contain real information. The child learns that their immediate response has value, even when it doesn't make obvious sense.</p>
                </div>

                  <h4>Separate Data from Story</h4>
                  <p>A story feels different from a descriptor. "Up, hard, land" is different from "It's a tall mountain with snow on top." The child learns to feel this difference in their own experience.</p>

                  <h4>It's Okay to Not Know</h4>
                  <p>Writing "none" for the helper word, taking a Miss break—these teach that not forcing an answer is a valid response. This is crucial. Trying too hard actually blocks the signal.</p>

                  <h4>Repetition Reveals Patterns</h4>
                  <p>Running the same target multiple times shows the child that some elements repeat (real signal) while others change randomly (mental noise). This is how they begin to recognize the difference.</p>

            <h3>About the Target Number</h3>
            <div className="explanation-block">
              <p>The target number (like "101" or "204-3") is just a neutral reference. It's not a code or a hint. It's simply a way to point the child's attention toward a specific target without giving away what that target is.</p>
              <p>Think of it like a library call number: it uniquely identifies something without describing it. This neutrality is important—it means the child's response is truly spontaneous, not influenced by the cue itself.</p>

              <h4>Body Check</h4>
              <p>Ask: "Is anything in your body or feelings bothering you a lot right now? Are you really tired, or hungry, or do you have a headache, or feel really upset?"</p>
              <p className="note">If they mention something but want to continue, write a small note: "Body note: tired" or similar. If they're very unwell or upset, reschedule—their body isn't a good receiver today.</p>

            </div>
            <p className="lead">Breaks are named ways to pause when the structure stops working. They teach the child that not forcing an answer is a valid and important response.</p>

            <h3>Why Breaks Matter</h3>
            <div className="explanation-block">
              <p>When a child can't make a mark, or starts telling elaborate stories, or feels confused—these aren't failures. They're signals that something different is happening in their awareness. By naming these moments and taking specific breaks, we teach the child to recognize different mental states and respond appropriately.</p>
              <p>This is a crucial skill: knowing when to push forward and when to pause is as important as the remote viewing itself.</p>
            </div>
          </div>

                <h3>Miss Break</h3>
              </div>
              <div className="break-content">
                <h4>When to Use</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Child says "I don't feel anything" right after the number</li>
                  <li>They stare at the page and can't make a mark</li>
                  <li>They slowly, deliberately draw a recognizable picture instead of making a quick stroke</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What to Say</h4>
                <div className="script-box">
                  <p>"Let's call that a Miss. That just means we didn't catch the first quick thing this time. I'll write 'Miss' here on the side. Shake your hands out, look around the room, take a breath, and we'll try the same number again."</p>
                </div>

                <h4>What to Do</h4>
                <p>Write "Miss" in the margin of the paper. Take a brief pause—literally have them shake their hands, look around, take a breath. Then repeat the number and start fresh.</p>

                <h4>Why This Works</h4>
                <p>Naming it as a "Miss" removes judgment and pressure. It's not "you failed" or "you did it wrong." It's "we didn't catch it that time." This keeps the experience light and allows them to try again without anxiety.</p>

              </div>
              <div className="break-content">
                <h4>When to Use</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Child gives long, detailed stories instead of simple descriptors</li>
                  <li>Example: "It's a big red castle with dragons flying around and flags on top and a moat"</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What to Say</h4>
                <div className="script-box">
                  <p>"That's a story. Stories are fine, but they're different from the little clue words we're practicing. I'm going to write 'Story: big red castle' over here on the side so it has its own place. Then we'll go back to a new fast mark and our little words."</p>
                </div>

                <h4>What to Do</h4>
                <p>Write "Story:" and a brief summary in the margin. Then start a fresh line with the same target number and guide them through the sequence again: fast mark, Move, Feel, Helper.</p>

                <h4>Why This Works</h4>
                <p>It validates that stories are interesting and real experiences, but it also clearly distinguishes them from the descriptive data we're collecting. The child learns that different kinds of mental content have different places in the process.</p>

                <h4>When to Use</h4>
                <ul>
                  <li>Child says "It's all mixed up" or "I don't know what I'm doing"</li>
                  <li>You see clear frustration or signs of being overwhelmed</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>What to Say</h4>
                <div className="script-box">
                  <p>"Let's take a Confused break. I'll write 'Confused' here. Let's stand up and stretch, maybe get a drink. Then we can decide if we want to try this number again or save it for another day."</p>
                </div>

                <h4>What to Do</h4>
                <p>Write "Confused" in the margin. Actually stand up and move—stretch, get water, walk around briefly. After the reset, evaluate together: do they want to try again, or is it time to end this session?</p>

                <h4>Why This Works</h4>
                <p>Confusion is a real experience that deserves acknowledgment. Sometimes the signal gets muddy, or the child's analytical mind is working too hard, or they're just tired. Naming it and taking a real break often clears things up. If it doesn't, that's information too—maybe today isn't the day.</p>
